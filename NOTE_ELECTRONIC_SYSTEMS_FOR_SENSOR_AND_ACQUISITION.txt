In this folder are included the files from the final group project of the course.

FILES:

"report_ESSA" -> pdf file with the presentation of the project

"main" -> code automatically generated from the STM32IDE environment and then modified for the
project.

"SerialCommunicationForProjects.py" -> Python script for the Serial Comunication

"plot_sensor_data" -> matlab file 

"Sample_of_SPACE_INVADERS" -> Video of the project, unfortunately there isn't any video of the
			      final project so it is affected from small errors, and is not
	                      on Pacman sky.



The board programming has been done leveraging the following environment:
-STM32CubeMX
-STM32CubeMonitor
-STM32CubeIDE 1.7.0
